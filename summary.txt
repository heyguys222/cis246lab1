Lab 2 summary

The first difference between the Ubuntu machine and CentOS machine are how ls does not 
return the same directories since they contain different files/directories.
Another difference is how uname -n returns CentOS rather than localhost.
The rm command when used in CentOS asks for a yes or no response while the Ubuntu machine does not.
When using the command echo "something new!!" , ubuntu returns
something newls
while CentOS returns: 
echo something newls 
something newls
